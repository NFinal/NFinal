    <h3>1.Preface</h3>
    <p>
        I'm start learn .net at 2001,at that time,.net isn't good for programer.<br />
        A few years later,Microsoft publish .net 2.0,I used visual studio 2005 to build website.<br />
        I can drag controlls to any page that very cool.when i get to work,i study lots of other languages,<br />
        include php,python,ruby,and so on.then i realize that Microsoft is autism.<br />
        At that time i learn some mvc thinking from brophp that is a simple php mvc framework.<br />
        After a lot of years, Mircorosoft publish .net mvc framewrok with razor engine,<br />
        then i start to study it,but i found that the design is not good.I's really not mvc thinking.<br />
        I suggest that .net programer should study some php framework,because of the thinking.<br />
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.Razor engine allow programer to write C# in views that is bad.</li>

        For example,thinkphp split the front work to html5 programer,and php programer.
        <br />
        <li>
            2..net mvc has some many functions that only 5% has been used.it's to big for me.
        </li>
        <li>
            3.Microsoft's Entility framework running speed is low,dapper Orm framework is faster than official.
        </li>
        <li>
            4..net mvc need study a long time.it's not like brophp,it's harder to master.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I want i mvc framework that only spend 10 minutes to study.half hour to use,one day to master.<br />
        I want i mvc framework that run faster than any other mvc framework with any language.<br />
        Then NFinal was born.<br />
